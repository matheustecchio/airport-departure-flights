# Airport Departure Flights

App to return all departure flights information of an specific airport in Ireland.

This application was made to check how busy the airport gate's area will, it's very important for staffs working in the gate area, as I was when I created this application.

### Why not to create the arrives flights?
As the purpose of this application was to check how busy the airport will be, having an arriving flights section wouldn't be useful for me. Because most of the customers in the landing area of the airport are airport's staffs and non-passengers in general, making it difficult to predict with flight information.
