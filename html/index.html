            <p>Application to return all departure flights information of an specific airport in Ireland.</p>
            <p>This application began to check how busy the airport gate's area will be. This information is very important for staffs working in the gate area, as I was when I created this application.</p>

            <h3>Why not to create the arrives flights?</h3>
            <p>Having an arriving flights section wouldn't be useful for the purpose of the project, which is to check how busy it will be,
            because most of the customers in the landing area of the airport are airport's staffs and non-passengers in general,
            making it difficult to predict with flight information.</p>
